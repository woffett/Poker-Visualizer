# Poker-Visualizer
To-do:
- sorting by average sum of squared difference compared to last iterates
  - choose how to sort the iterates
  - whether algorithms converge to the same thing
  - consider convergence speed of the two algorithms (comparing integrals)
  - always put the worst first
- develop dropdown with changing actions that are available
- optional sub-sampling
  - default: no sub-sampling
- add triangles to 3-action infosets
