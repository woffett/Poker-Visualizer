# Poker-Visualizer
To-do:
- look at the "creating interactive dashboards" tutorial for HoloViews
- fix persistent "raise2" bug
      - REASON: holoviews won't update the dimension "raise2" until it
        sees a new curve with a "raise2" dimension
- investigate ndlayout format for examining multiple iterates
- sort by lowest action per infoset
- add triangles to 3-action infosets
- compare EGT vs CFR+ alg data
