PROGRESS:
	- Holoview is quite inflexible, unable to nest drop-downs in notebook
		- Considering possibly nesting multiple holomaps in an exported html, without using a notebook
	- Sorting is not possible unless you make it a key dimension
		(better to replace infoset name with gradient?)
   	- Consider an ndlayout format for small subsets of games?
		- Again, Holoview doesn't allow nesting with these and HoloMap
  	- No work on triangle stuff yet (sad face)

- ask about SURF project possibilities (deadline is March 23, should have proposal draft < a week before)
